django-boilerplate - yet another django project layout
******************************************************

Description
***********

django-boilerplate is an attempt to set up a standard convention for Django app
layouts, to assist in writing utilities to deploy such applications. A bit of
convention can go a long way.

Directory structure
================

apps
----

All of your Django "apps" go in this directory. These have models, views, forms,
templates or all of the above. These should be Python packages you would add to
your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list.

Everything in this directory is added to the ``PYTHONPATH`` when
the ``setup`` function from ``env.py`` is invoked.

There's one predefined app: ``core``. Every base classes should be placed here.
It's also a place to keep your project-level static files. Here's how you might
to organize it::

  apps/core/static/core/      <== application's css, js, img
  apps/core/static/core/lib/  <== css, js libraries

Why is that?

When ``collectstatic`` commands creates the content of ``static`` folder it just
copy contents of static folders from each app. We decide that the best way
to keep clean, resonable and simple structure, will be keeping all static
dependentcies to ``core`` app.

Since django 1.5 we treat it as a main container -- ``apps`` is default name of project (that's why it is module).

lib
---

Third party Python packages and/or django-apps. Everything in this directory
is added to the ``PYTHONPATH`` when the ``setup`` function from  ``env.py``
is invoked or ``python manage.py runserver``

log
---

Default place to store logs from your loggers. We recommend ./log/$app/ for keeping logs of $app django application.

static
------

This folder is fully auto-generated. You don't even need to create it.
It will be created by ``manage.py collectstatic`` command line tool.


req
------------

pip requirements files, optionally one for each app environment. The
``common.txt`` is installed in every case. Additionaly packages.txt
contains information about specific system wide packages needs.


apps/settings
--------

Settings which enable distinction between default and local scope. Each environment gets it's own ``apps/settings/local.py`` which is NOT shared across CVS. Only default.py should be placed there. Settings from default.py are covered by each environment local.py versions.

We provide ``local-dev-sample.py`` which is project boilerplate to start with, just copy it to ``local.py`` and You are ready to start off!

Additionaly we think that urls.py fit in here nicely.


Files
-----

- env.py

Introduces ``setup`` function that modifies the ``PYTHONPATH`` to allow importing
from the ``apps`` and ``lib`` directories. It also provide WSGI application interface.
Just point dir of WSGI to ``/boilerplate-django-project/`` and give ``env`` as a module.

- manage.py

The standard Django ``manage.py``.
